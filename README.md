# SSIDMapper
This project is a POC that can be used to by information security professionals and hobbyists. The intent is to demonstrate to less technical customers or people in general just how much personal information can be derived from their mobile devices (phones, laptops, tablets) by running simple passive 802.11 collection. We use uses a mixture of Kismet, Wigle, Python, Javascript, and HTML to correlate captured probed SSIDs to physical addresses. The Python script will run Kismet for a chosen period of time (e.g. 5 minutes), extract probed SSIDs from the generated .kismet database file, and use the Wigle API to find physical addresses that have been correlated to those SSIDs. It then runs a simple HTTP server using an HTML and Javascript file to display a chart clearly matching results from probed SSIDs and addresses. The Javascript and HTML files are very minimal to provide room for extreme flexability so anyone can tailor it to their organizational or personal needs.
